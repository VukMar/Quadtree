# Quadtree
## Practice project. 

My own implementation of a QuadTree. Visualised by SFML library.
The QuadTree coantains elements with are represented by an Element class. 
This Element class contains position in 2d space, identification number and pointer to custom object.
The custom object pointer is stored in void pointer.
In order to get the objet the void pointer must be staticly cast to the object type.

If anyone sees this procject feel free to add changes if something can be improved.

Here is a visual:

To remove the QuadTree grid simply press left control.


Thanks!
